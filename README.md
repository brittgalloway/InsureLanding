# Frontend Mentor - Insure Landing Page
This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor Insure Landing Page challenge. The goal was to build the landing page and match it as closely as possible to the provided design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML – Structured the content and ensured semantic markup.
- Sass (SCSS) – Used for styling, with a focus on reusable variables and modular styles.
- JavaScript – Used minimally, mainly for interactive elements.
- CSS Popover API – Experimented with the <popover> attribute for handling the mobile navigation menu without JavaScript.
## Features
- Responsive Design – The page adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- Minimal JavaScript Approach – Wherever possible, native HTML and CSS solutions were used instead of JavaScript.
- Accessible Navigation – Implemented a mobile-friendly navigation menu with the CSS Popover API.
## Challenges & Learnings
- CSS Popover API – This was a great opportunity to experiment with the native <popover> attribute, which simplified the mobile navigation toggle without needing JavaScript.
- Layout & Spacing – Since the provided design was in a static format, I relied on judgment for font sizes, padding, and margins.
